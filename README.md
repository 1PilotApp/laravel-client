<p><strong>[You]</strong> What are you, strange being?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> Greetings, traveller. I am 1Pilot. I am a tool created to monitor and manage earthbound Laravel applications.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> OK... What is your primary purpose?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> I was created to reduce the time you spend managing applications, so that you can focus on your primary mission.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> Wait, what? How could you know... What is my primary mission?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> My records indicate that your primary mission is ...searching database... to code in your underwear, jamming to Radiohead.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> ðŸ˜²... ðŸ¤ª... Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> Affirmative, traveller. â€˜Sweetâ€™.</p>

... _Introduction protocol complete_ ...

You have just discovered our advanced monitoring tool for your Laravel applications and all the individual sites that you manage. We have designed it as a central dashboard to harmonise the maintenance of your entire website roster. Because we believe that coders should be out there coding. Let computers monitor computers, so that we humans donâ€™t have to worry about it.

We searched the galaxy for a robust answer to our challenges, and found none. So, our team embarked on our greatest mission yet and 1Pilot was born.
